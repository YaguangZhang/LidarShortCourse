# A Crash Course on How to Use LiDAR Data

This repository contains interactive scripts to demonstrate how to obtain and take advantage of public LiDAR data sets for the US. It will be an ongoing effort to include

- resources,
- example data files,
- and code in Bash, Matlab, and Python with detailed documentation,

to demonstrate the key concepts including 

- common LiDAR data types, 
- popular LiDAR file formats, 
- projected coordinate systems, 
- tile indexing, and 
- LiDAR data visualization.

## Introduction

As a low-cost approach for obtaining high-precision geographic information, LiDAR is becoming increasingly popular around the world during the past decades. More and more LiDAR measurement results on large geographical areas are becoming available to the public.

These LiDAR records are not only fun to play with, but also extremely useful in a variety of research areas. For example, our group has been using LiDAR data for projects in telecommunication and transportation systems:

1. Investigating system-level coverage for cellular networks, possibly with data relay drones, over a large geographic area. More details can be found in our [GitHub Repositary](https://github.com/YaguangZhang/CellCoverageMapperForDronesMatlabWorkspace) and our paper below.
